# Sales Transaction Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a retail sales transaction dataset. It covers the process of data cleaning, preprocessing, and uncovering patterns using visualizations.

## Dataset Overview

- The dataset contains retail transaction records.
- Key columns include Transaction ID, Customer ID, Category, Item, Price Per Unit, Quantity, Total Spent, Payment Method, Location, Transaction Date, and Discount Applied.

## Data Cleaning

- Identified missing values in several numeric and categorical columns.
- Missing values in price, quantity, and total spent were filled or dropped as needed to maintain consistency.
- Discount Applied column was filled with default 'False' where missing.
- Transaction Date was converted to a consistent datetime format using day-month-year pattern.

## Key Findings

- Some product categories and items generate significantly more revenue than others.
- Discounts have a limited but noticeable impact on customer spending.
- Certain locations contribute heavily to overall sales.
- Monthly sales trends reveal periodic patterns that can inform business strategy.
